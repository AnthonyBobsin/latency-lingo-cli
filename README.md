# Latency Lingo CLI

[Latency Lingo](https://latencylingo.com) is a platform to help your engineering team analyze and collaborate on performance test result data.

This CLI helps publish test metrics from your load test runner to Latency Lingo APIs. jMeter .jtl files are currently supported with Locust, k6 and Gatling formats planned.
