# Latency Lingo CLI

[Latency Lingo](https://latencylingo.com) is a platform to help your engineering team analyze and collaborate on performance test result data.

This CLI helps publish test metrics from your load test runner to Latency Lingo APIs. jMeter .jtl files are currently supported with Locust, k6 and Gatling formats planned.

## Usage

Install the appropriate executable from [the latest release](https://github.com/AnthonyBobsin/latency-lingo-cli/releases/latest).

Example for OS X with x86 chips.
```sh
curl -L https://github.com/AnthonyBobsin/latency-lingo-cli/releases/latest/download/latency-lingo-cli_1.0.0_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz
```

Invoke the `publish` command with the location of your .jtl file generated by jMeter.
```sh
./latency-lingo-cli publish --file <file_name>
```

The publish command also supports publishing events for an existing report ID. This is useful when using [https://latencylingo.com/reports/new](the report creation page in our UI).

```sh
./latency-lingo-cli publish --file <file_name> --report <report_uuid>
```
